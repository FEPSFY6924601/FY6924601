         Time is important to all modern civilisations, and this article aims to examine its most prominent developments.
         Firstly, I explain how shadows were used to measure the passage of time and its limitations,
         then how mechanical clocks and marine chronometers improved accuracy by controlling motion. Finally,
         I explore how atomic clocks and clock-fusion systems generate precise results forming todays global time infrastructure</p>

           Throughout thousands of years, Time has been essential to the organisation, technology, economy,
           and communication within mordem civilisation. Consequently, individuals have device continuous and innovative methods to measure time,
           ranging from the geometry of shadows, shipp ready chronometers and exact fusion clocks. Society has looked enhance each iteration
           with creative new solutions to addressability issues such as motion temperature gravity and most recently signal loss.

       <p id="Sundials_InText">
         Some tiles are broadly recognised as the earliest tools used for time measurement.
         They operate by tracking the shadows cast upon an object as the Suns position relative to the Earth shifts,
         Thereby indicating the apparent solar time.  The earliest known sundials 15,000  BCE, with Thutmose III in Egypt,
         exemplifying the ancient human inclination to quantify the passage of time.
         A significant limitation these devices is that being measured “seasonal hours” and flying that the duration of an hour varies throughout the equations of daylight.
         Additionally they are fundamentally restricted by the dependence on sunlight rendering them ineffective at night ordering overcast conditions. <br> <br> Citations:

          Gravity and weight driven Clocks
          are the earliest devices for timekeeping independent from celestial observations,
          thereby making a significant technological advancement. The earliest tower clocks for documented between the 13th and 14th centuries,
          they utilised suspended weights that supplied a continuous source of power to gear trains regulated by the verge-and-foliot escapement. This mechanism-controlled energy release in discrete periodic “ticks”,
          enables continuous time measurement. Christiaan Huygens introduced the pendulum in 1656, which further improve the accuracy of timekeeping by using isochronous oscillations enabling daily error should be reduced from minutes to seconds.
          Escapements also played a significant raw by transforming gravity into control movement enabling better measurements of time. However, these clocks face challenges such as gear train friction, temperature fluctuations and sensitivity to movement,
          making them unreliable when transported despite these limitations gravity clocks laid the foundation for mordem clocks. <br> <br> Citations:

     <p id="Marinechronometersandstabiliser_InText">
         Accurate timekeeping became an essential component of sea travel in the 18th century as a determining the longitude required a precise comparison between local time and a reliable reference,
         typically Greenwitch mean time, traditional pendulum clocks were unsuitable for ships because of the constant motion, humidity and temperature changes, 
         which negatively affected the pendulous accuracy resulting in significant navigational errors. John Harrison’s innovation revolutionised Marine timekeeping with chronometers that replaced the pendulum with a spring mechanism,
         his design Incorporated anti-friction bearing materials to counter thermal expansion and anti-gravity features that minimise the variation rate within the motion. The adoption of gimballed mounts further stabilise kilometre ensuring the state level despite a ship motion by 18th century,
         marine kilometres enable safer and more exact navigation, supporting transoceanic trade and scientific exploration by reducing navigational uncertainty. Harrison’s model established the global standard for portable timekeeping at sea representing a pivotal milestone in maritime science and technology.

      <h3 id="Clockfusion">Clock fusion</h3>

      <p id="Clockfusion_InText">
         Modern “clock fusion” refers to the integration of multiple time sources such as a Caesium atomic clock, GNSS-discipline oscillators, and network-based feeds.
         They use hardware and algorithmic frameworks to enhance accuracy performance, 
         creating a resilience against signal loss or manipulation.
         Rather than relying on a single best source, 
         Fusion clocks operate by continuously comparing different inputs and weighing their reliability, switching their source to the most accurate, therefore outputting a stable time throughout.
         Furthermore, clock fusion mitigates various vulnerabilities by incorporating secure local oscillators, checking sources, and confirming signal integrity before distribution. This
         approach ensures continuity of precise time even when external reference degrades or fails, marking a strategic shift from unreliable single source clocks to distributed, verified resilient timekeeping. <br> <br> Citations:

         Atomic clocks are some of the most accurate devices ever created fountain clocks like those built by NIST can you keep time with an eternity as small as one part in 10^16 means they lose less than a second over millions of years.
         They work by measuring the natural vibration of cesium atoms which says an extremely stable overtime. GPS satellite also use atomic clocks to provide precise location data however because satellite move fast and orbit and we could gravity they their clocks run slightly different rates relativity corrections
         are applied to keep them accurate. Vivaldi corrections UPS with drift by kilometres each day to get atomic and GPS clocks support navigation, communication, communications and global timekeeping. <br> <br> Citations:

      <p id="Conclusion_InText">
         In conclusion, from shadow-based sundials to gravitational escapements, marine chronometers, Clock fusion systems, 
         and relativistic satellite time, each technological advancement addresses a stability change such as dependence of sunlight, 
         control of storage energy variations in motion, and temperature, to signal integrity, and relativistic drift. These innovations have transformed timekeeping from a solely local observation into a globally synchronised infrastructure.
