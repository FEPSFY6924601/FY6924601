         Time is important to all modern civilisations, and this article aims to examine its most prominent developments.
         Firstly, I explain how shadows were used to measure the passage of time and its limitations,
         then how mechanical clocks and marine chronometers improved accuracy by controlling motion. Finally,
         I explore how atomic clocks and clock-fusion systems generate precise results forming todays global time infrastructure</p>

           Throughout thousands of years, Time has been essential to the organisation, technology, economy,
           and communication within mordem civilisation. Consequently, individuals have device continuous and innovative methods to measure time,
           ranging from the geometry of shadows, shipp ready chronometers and exact fusion clocks. Society has looked enhance each iteration
           with creative new solutions to addressability issues such as motion temperature gravity and most recently signal loss.

         Some tiles are broadly recognised as the earliest tools used for time measurement.
         They operate by tracking the shadows cast upon an object as the Suns position relative to the Earth shifts,
         Thereby indicating the apparent solar time.  The earliest known sundials 15,000  BCE, with Thutmose III in Egypt,
         exemplifying the ancient human inclination to quantify the passage of time.
         A significant limitation these devices is that being measured “seasonal hours” and flying that the duration of an hour varies throughout the equations of daylight.
         Additionally they are fundamentally restricted by the dependence on sunlight rendering them ineffective at night ordering overcast conditions. <br> Citations
